Generating random paragraphs can be an excellent way for writers to get their creative flow going at the beginning of the day. The writer has no idea what topic the random paragraph will be about when it appears. This forces the writer to use creativity to complete one of three common writing challenges. The writer can use the paragraph as the first one of a short story and build upon it. A second option is to use the random paragraph somewhere in a short story they create. The third option is to have the random paragraph be the ending paragraph in a short story. No matter which of these challenges is undertaken, the writer is forced to use creativity to incorporate the paragraph into their writing.",

            "OT was asked to speak with Mr Reams and determine his physical abilities since his stroke.  On Thursday 8/29/24 OT met him in his room while he was laying on the bed.  He was Mod I supine to sitting EOB with no difficulties.  OT asked him to don and doff his socks and shoe on one foot.  He demonstrated Mod I with no LOB or difficulties doffing and donning his sock and shoe using only his left hand.  OT then asked him to transfer to the WC and come into the bathroom.  He was Mod I scooting to the EOB and sit to stand then stand pivot to the WC.  He was Mod I self-propelling himself (using his left arm and leg) to the bathroom.  OT asked him to transfer to the commode and he locked the WC brakes, stood and slowly walked to the commode.  He used the grab bar but demonstrated good balance and safety awareness Mod I transferring on and off the commode.  OT then took him into the life skills room.  OT asked him to get a bottle of water from the fridge.  He again locked the brakes on the WC and stood to walk.  He did steady himself once standing but he used the windowsill (sturdy and safe) and then walked to the fridge.  He has an unusual gait but it is slow and steady.  OT asked him about using a cane and he was interested.  OT does not have one to give him today but had one he could practice with.  He was instructed to use the cane in his left hand at the same time as his right leg and he demonstrated understanding with minimal cues.  He stated that he is interested in getting a cane and practicing walking so OT will work on that.  Once in the kitchen he retrieved the water bottle from the fridge with good safety awareness.  OT then asked him to get something from the cabinet over the stove.  He completed this with Mod I with no issues.  OT then placed the item on the floor and asked him to get it.  He widened his stance and steadied himself using the counter before leaning over to get the item.  He demonstrated good balance and safety awareness during this activity.  OT then filled a small pot with water and asked him to take it off the stove and pour it out in the sink (approx. 3 feet away).  He carried the pot in his left hand and walked to the sink.  OT instructed him to be careful carrying hot items and to drag it along the counter top and he verbalized understanding.  OT then sat him down and performed PROM of his right hand and elbow.  He has the WFL PROM elbow flexion and extension.  He states that when he sleeps his hand will fully relax.

He immediately raised his voice and asked what I was talking about.  I attempted to inform him that I was alerted that he had not turned in this medication for a few months before this one (see previous case note that I entered from the logbook).  He immediately cut me off, raised his voice and started getting defensive; stating that he had turned this one in when he received it.  I calmly asked him to lower his voice and if I could explain the situation, we could have a discussion.  I tried to explain to him what I was referring to, but he would not calm down and would not listen to anything I had to say.  He became very agitated to the point where I did not feel comfortable giving him his controlled substance (mood altering narcotic) in his current state.  I attempted several times to communicate this to him, but he was unable to calm down and have a conversation with me about our policy and the report I heard from staff.  He very loudly and angrily walked off, exclaiming he was going to call Cynthia at the VA and tell them I wasn\u0027t giving him his meds.  I replied that was not the case, that I needed to make sure he understood our medication policies in order to have this medication while in the program.  He would not let me finish, continuing to interrupt me.  He walked off and went up to his dorm.\n\nHad he persisted with the demand for his medication, I would have complied but with the expectation that he acknowledged understanding of our policy and if he did not comply with that expectation, but still demanded his medication, I would have asked him to leave and come back the next day.  \n\nI am emailing the VA team and will discuss with the team and Cynthia on Tuesday.  \n",

They had stayed outside of the Mission last night, as the mother was told that she could not be with the kids at the Women’s Mission because she was unfit to take care of the children. All three adults had autism/developmental disabilities. They got stranded in Nashville from a previous attempt at Traveler’s Aid. We were able to get them all food and showers and worked with James from the Mission on splitting a ticket to Miami. This came after the Mission had bought them a ticket to Louisville, but they then weren’t able to stay with the family member. They are going to stay with Edward’s mother in Miami, and we agreed to pay the Mission $350 to split the cost of the bus ticket. /TL",

Our staff is not medically trained however, has observed his inability to propel his wheelchair more than a couple of feet, go to the bathroom independently or transfer from wheelchair to floor bed (which is all we have available). Mr. Peters is constantly asking for food and there is concern that he is suffering from intestinal parasites. I observed him eat a full plate at 11:30 and was asking for additional food by 1:30. His paralysis makes him excessively vulnerable to predators if living in the streets; Room In The Inn and The Nashville Rescue Mission do not have medical staff available which makes him inappropriate to rest at either place. Nichola B., Mental Health Cooperative, is his caseworker. We spoke earlier today and agrees that he needs more help than a homeless shelter can provide. (Please feel free to reach out to her at 615-743-1555.)\nI am told Mr. Peters may become verbally combative and refuse to cooperate with medical personnel. With his background of being chronically homeless, opposition of authority may be a survival skill from living in the streets and therefor considered part of his trauma response. In addition, we called 911 on 8/22/24 and he took his medications with him. When he was returned to Room In The Inn early on 8/23/24 he didn’t have any medications with him, so he is without appropriate medications.\n",

They informed me that a participant, Sunshine Jorell Wilson, needed medical attention and due to my medical background, they asked me to take a look. \n\nUpon seeing Sunshine, it quickly became apparent that they had experienced a severe blunt force trauma to the forehead.  There was a baseball size knot with a severe laceration in the shape of a “Y” approximately 2 inches in width and 1-1.5 inches in height in the middle area of the forehead.  Sunshine was bleeding significantly.  I first asked Sunshine some questions to make sure that the cognition was not affected and something more serious might need to be addressed.  Sunshine was able to answer the questions for me to think they were in the right mind. \n\nI first assessed the wound and knot, checking the surrounding areas and making sure there were not other areas of concern.  While preparing supplies for addressing the wound, we applied an ice pack to the area to manage the swelling as best possible.  I was able to clean the wound, temper the bleeding and bandage the area while we waited for EMS and Mobile Crisis to arrive.\n\nAfter 45min to an hour passed, I felt that Sunshine was somewhat stable and I had done all I could do to assist the situation and treat the wound.  There were two other managers with Sunshine, so I left them to wait for EMS and Mobile Crisis to arrive. \n\nPer staff, after I left, the bleeding continued and the swelling spread to the orbital area. \n\nOther observations:\n- Sunshine was in severe mental anguish, repeating multiple times: “I don’t know why he would do this to me” and “I never thought this was possible”. \n- Sunshine’s pants were caked in mud and soaking wet.  Upon questioning about this, Sunshine stated that the only way to get away from the assailants was to roll into the Cumberland River. \n- Sunshine stated that the assailants were known and had been “close” to them, then repeating the phrases mentioned above. \n- Sunshine stated that they walked from the Cumberland to our campus and no one stopped to help or ask if they were okay, this also caused Sunshine to cry and hyperventilate. \n- Sunshine repeatedly broke down in tears, causing hyperventilation multiple times; I was able to coach Sunshine through breathing to calm down.

Participant Walsh informed CC Sjodin that he had called 911 for himself and CC Sjodin explained that Staff make calls to emergency services in order to ensure that EMS knows where to go. CC Sjodin encouraged Participant Walsh to place a call to Mobile Crisis, but Participant Walsh said that calling Mobile Crisis \"would not be necessary.\" CC Sjodin further reinforced that Mobile Crisis would need to be called if Participant Walsh was experiencing a mental health emergency because RITI does not have mental/physical Healthcare providers and CC Sjodin wanted to be sure that Participant Walsh received the support he needs. Participant Walsh maintained that calling Mobile Crisis was not necessary and that the ambulance was on the way to pick him up. CC Sjodin asked why Participant Walsh was opposed to speaking to Mobile Crisis and Participant Walsh restated that the police and an ambulance were on the way to pick him up. Participant Walsh proceeded to step to the GH phone and dial 911 again, asking the operator if the ambulance \u0026 police were on their way.

Participant Walsh continued his phone call, brushing CC Sjodin off saying that he would leave when EMS arrived.
